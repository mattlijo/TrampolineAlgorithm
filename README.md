TRAMPOLINE

Java does not support tail recursion optimisation sometimes scaling a recursive code can blowup the stack. Trampoline pattern helps implement algorithms recursively yet executed in iteratively. 

Contents:

Code is implemented for factorial(most cliched recursion problem)

Test: 

A sample test to prove the use case.
